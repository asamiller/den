# Den
Den is an iPhone app built with React Native for viewing houses for sale in the NW from rmls.com. After being frustrated with a site that hasn't changed since 2004, I decided to build a better viewing experience in the phone.

The app was built in a weekend (or so) by one designer and one developer.
